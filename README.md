### Project description
You are probably becoming more and more aware that you can find data pretty much everywhere. Any time you observe and evaluate something in the world, you are collecting and analyzing data. Your analysis helps you to find easier ways of doing things, to identify patterns, to save your time and to discover surprising new perspectives that can completely change the way you experience things. The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. You will have to apply these six steps in your first practical project.

### Evaluation criteria:
- The six steps of data analyses are followed.
- Clearly defined a problem you are trying to solve.
- Data analysis is presented as a consistent story.
- Analysis, findings and main points are clearly structured.
- Google Sheets, visualization are clear and communicate the message/answer.
- At least one chart is used in the analysis.
